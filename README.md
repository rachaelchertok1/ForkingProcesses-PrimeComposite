# ForkingProcesses-PrimeComposite
Please see README for description of this project

Tasks assigned for this project:
1.	Create a child process
2.	Assign the child process to generate a random integer (N) within 0 to 100
3.	And, the child process must send that random integer (N) to the parent process
4.	If the random integer (N) is prime, then the parent process must send the message “PRIME” to the child process
5.	If the random integer (N) is composite, then the parent process must send the message “COMPOSITE” to the child process
6.	The child process must print the message sent by the parent process
